# webring-starter

Webring Starter is a modern, simple webring that anyone can setup and use!

In the early days of the World Wide Web, webrings were a popular way for people
to connect through common interests. People used CGI scripts to run these, but
today, a lot can be done with just a few lines of JavaScript on static websites.

This starter site is built with Jekyll as a static site and can be used with
GitHub Pages. It also uses modern interoperability standards, and provides an
[Atom RSS](https://validator.w3.org/feed/docs/atom.html) feed of member sites'
posts (if they provide an Atom or RSS feed), an [OPML](http://opml.org/) file
of the members that folks can subscribe to with their RSS readers, and a
[FOAF](http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/) file for portability of discovering members.
